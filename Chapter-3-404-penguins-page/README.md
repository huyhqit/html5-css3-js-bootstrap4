## 404 Start Code

### Overview

- Make 404 page

### Details
- CSS:
    - `z-index`: 
        - The `z-index` property specifies the stack order of an element. An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
        - `z-index` only works on positioned elements (position:absolute, position:relative, or position:fixed).
    -  `@keyframes` rule specifiles the animation code.
    - The `position` property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).
    - CSS `transitions` allows you to change property values smoothly (from one value to another), over a given duration.
